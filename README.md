## Computer Vision Data Analysis Project 

<p align="justify">This project aims to develop a data visualization showcasing conference-related information over the years. It involves presenting statistics such as the quantity of published papers, identifying the most established authors around the globe, and many more. Notably, the main focus is on comparing the number of authors and published papers from Indonesia with those from other Southeast Asian countries and globally. With the help of this project, I've also contributed to the [Awesome Indonesia Computer Vision Research - Conference Publication](https://github.com/indonesia-vision-ai/awesome-indonesia-vision-research-conference) repository. The conferences considered for this analysis span from 2002 to the present and include BMVC, WACV, CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV.</p>
